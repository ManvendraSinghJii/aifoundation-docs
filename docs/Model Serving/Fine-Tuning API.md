## Upload API
### Introduction

This document provides an overview of how to use the Upload API to upload files for various purposes, including fine-tuning, embedding, and ingestion. It also describes features for listing and deleting files, as well as a special endpoint for validating dataset formats. The Upload API can be integrated with the OpenAI package in Python.

### Dependencies requirements

```python
pip install openai
```

### Setting Environment Variables

First, set the environment variables for the API base URL and API key.

In terminal:

```
export API_BASE=https://llm-server.llmhub.t-systems.net
# Adding LLMHUB API key
export API_KEY=YOUR_LLMHUB_KEY
# Testing the API_BASE
curl $API_BASE
# Testing the API_KEY
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" $API_BASE
```

**Output:**

```
env: API_BASE=https://llm-server.llmhub.t-systems.net
{"T-Systems Uploading Server":"online"}
env: API_KEY=YOUR_LLMHUB_KEY
```

### Initialize the Client

Initialize the OpenAI client with the API key and base URL.

In Python:

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

api_base = os.getenv('API_BASE')
api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv('API_KEY'),
    base_url=os.getenv('API_BASE') +'/v1'
)
```

### Upload File

#### Upload datasets for Fine-Tuning

To upload a file for fine-tuning purposes, provide "purpose" as "fine-tune".

```python
client.files.create(
    file=open("/Path/to/your/file/demo.txt", "rb"),
    purpose="fine-tune"
)
```

**Output:**

```
FileObject(id='fine-tune-upload1-demo', bytes=781, created_at='2024-06-25T11:24:17 (CEST)', filename='demo.txt', object='file', purpose='fine-tune', status=None, status_details=None, checksum='1825e8c857c78e160109115c9857e592')
```

#### Request Body

**file** file: <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Required</span> 

The File object (not file name) to be uploaded.

**purpose** string: <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Required</span> 

The intended purpose of the uploaded file. Use "fine-tune" for Fine-tuning.

### List Uploaded Files

List all the files that have been uploaded.

```python
files_list = client.files.list()

# Iterate over the files and print their details
for file_obj in files_list.data:
    print(f"ID: {file_obj.id}")
    print(f"Bytes: {file_obj.bytes}")
    print(f"Created At: {file_obj.created_at}")
    print(f"Filename: {file_obj.filename}")
    print(f"Object: {file_obj.object}")
    print(f"Purpose: {file_obj.purpose}")
    print(f"Checksum: {file_obj.checksum}")
    print("-" * 40)
```

**Output:**

```
ID: fine-tune-upload1-demo
Bytes: 781
Created At: 2024-06-25T11:24:17 (CEST)
Filename: demo.txt
Object: file
Purpose: fine-tune
Checksum: 1825e8c857c78e160109115c9857e592
----------------------------------------
```

### Delete File

Delete a specific file by its ID.

```python
client.files.delete("fine-tune-upload1-demo")
```

**Output:**

```
FileDeleted(id='fine-tune-upload1-demo', deleted=True, object='file')
```

#### Request Body

**file_id** string: <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Required</span> 

The ID of the file to be deleted. This ID can be obtained from the list files function.

## Validate Dataset

The validate endpoint ensures the quality and correctness of datasets in the OpenAI template used for fine-tuning models. This endpoint helps identify and rectify potential issues in your dataset before proceeding with the fine-tuning process.

### Sample Dataset

Here's an example of a sample dataset in JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "messages": [
            {"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "What's the capital of France?"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paris", "weight": 0},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Can you be more sarcastic?"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.", "weight": 1}
        ]
    }
]
```

### Validate Dataset Example

```bash
curl  -X  'POST'  \
'http://localhost:8017/v1/val_dataset?file_id=fine-tune-upload_4-Depth-aware_convolutional_neural_networks_for_accurate_3D_pose_estimation_in_RGB.jsonl' \
-H  'accept: application/json'  \
-d ''
```

**Output:**

```
{"id":"fine-tune-upload_4-Depth-aware_convolutional_neural_networks_for_accurate_3D_pose_estimation_in_RGB.jsonl","errors":["No errors found"],"object":"file"}
```

#### Request Body

**file_id** string: <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Required</span> 

The ID of the file to be validated.

# LM Benchmarking & Monitoring
In the Fine-Tuning API, an benchmarking pipeline for the fine-tuned LLM model is integrated using state-of-the-art benchmarking frameworks: LM Evaluation Harness and the Needle in a Haystack method for LLM evaluation.
Additionally, MLflow is used to monitor both the training and benchmarking processes. You can view your training and benchmarking scores at:Â https://mlflow.llm-serving-dev.llmhub.t-systems.net.

## LM Benchmarking
### LM Evaluation Harness Benchmark
This is a widely used benchmarking framework designed to evaluate language models across various tasks. In this scope, We used it to measure the modelâs performance post-fine-tuning. The evaluation tasks included most widely used benchmark tasks such as:

- **MMLU** (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): A task that evaluates models' knowledge across multiple domains including STEM, humanities, social sciences, etc.
- **HellaSwag**: A commonsense reasoning task that requires models to predict the most appropriate ending to a given story.
- **ARC Challenge**: A dataset consisting of science questions used to test reasoning and logic.
- **GPQA**: A multiple-choice, Q&A dataset of very hard questions written and validated by experts in biology, physics, and chemistry.

### RAG Needle in a Haystack Benchmark
The Needle in a Haystack benchmark tests the model's ability to answer questions by finding relevant information within a larger context, the goal is for the model to find the correct information (the "needle") amidst many unrelated details (the "haystack").

To make this task more challenging, extra irrelevant information (distractors) is added alongside the correct context. Increasing the amount of this noise makes it harder for the model to locate the right answer.

The model's performance is measured using the custom GEval metric from Deepeval https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals, specifically evaluating Correctnessâensuring the output matches the expected answer and penalizing incorrect or incomplete responses
| Metric scores vs. Context length | Metrics scores vs. Number of Chunks      |

## MLflow Monitoring
With MLflow, you can now monitor each fine-tuning job. Every time you use a new model or a new dataset, a new MLflow experiment is automatically created. In the Runs section, you can find your fine-tuning job by its run name and timestamp.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f4cd6fc-2da3-4cd2-a7de-16f4d1113540)

For each fine-tuning job, there are two main runs for monitoring:

### 1. Monitoring Fine-Tuning Process

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5d98068-23fa-412d-9c94-5e53dc2b2023)

### 2. Monitoring Benchmarking Scores

In Mlflow artifacts, you will find the LM Evaluation Harness Benchmark scores and RAG Needle in a Haystack Benchmark scores for your Fine-Tuned Model.
